## What is this?
This page obviously is about a syntax theme, but for this one we have somehow a back story that is way different than just different coloring.

When people say beautiful codes they always mean less complexity or clever code but when we say that we mean it for real. The code must look nice when you read it. In order to manage the code we invented [Kary Foundation’s Coding Style (KFCS)](https://github.com/karyfoundation/comment/wiki) and the fact that we have a very restricted way of [coding style](http://kary.us/2015/02/12/arendelle-coding-styles/). 

Now beauty matters but also it’s the psychology that matters. As developers what you see all day long is code. So it matters that the code be pretty and it matters that your editor is pretty because well it’s your life happening behind it. But how should it look? what colors must be there? 

For what we know we all are playful people. We have an active inner child. Our editors must look like playgrounds. We have developed a rainbow colored theme. With worm colors chosen very carefully for the finest code quality possible. 

From what we noticed [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) has the most carefully defined experience. We loved the `gold` and `red`/`orange` colors used by their highlighter and inspired by their design we shaped a coding experience that for us was the most joyful look of the code ever possible.
